# Django-Airlines-Booking-Simulator
This was my first Django project. I honestly learnt a bunch from it and it was a great place to start.

Please by all means use this code for educational purposes. If you do use it directly, please let me know. It'll make me happy! :D

How to use the website:
You should be able to navigate around the website without struggling. Everything's pretty straight forward and if you are confused about something, the code will help you figure out what it does!
